        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How does a browser know to just use a text input if it does not support a new type of input? Does it just revert to the default if it doesn't 
                have anything set up to handle a new type?
            </li>
            <li>
                What is the difference between a prototype-based language and a class-based language? I don't entirely understand
                why there are distinctions made between classes and objects in that way exactly. It is probably something to do with deeper
                implementation of the languages that I don't understand.
