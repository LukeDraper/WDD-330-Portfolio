        <h2>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>
            The inner functions of objects are kept secret, and only essential functionalities are exposed to the user.
            Users know what to input to get desired output. That's about it. This lets implementation details change without
            upending the users.
        </p>
        <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
        <p>
            Objects can share the same process, but have the ability to override shared methods
            with more specific implementation.
        </p>
        <h3>Inheritance</h3>
        <p>
            In object-oriented programming we can take any object and inherit its properties and methods.
            We can then improve it by adding new properties and methods or overriding some of the existing ones.
        </p>
        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <p>
            Classes define blueprints for creating objects. Classes are new to Javascript, and it is a prototype-based language
            rather than a class-based language. It uses objects as a prototype for creating new objects. The objects based on the prototypes can
            do everything the prototype could do with some being able to do more.
        </p>

        <h3>Constructor functions</h3>
        <p>
            Object literal notation can be used to create objects:
            <pre>
                const dice = {
                    sides: 6,
                    roll() {
                        return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                    }    
                }
            </pre>
            Constructor Functions can too:
            <pre>
                const Dice = function(sides=6){
                    this.sides = sides;
                    this.roll = function() {
                        return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                    }
                }
            </pre>

            Create an instance of the dice object: 
            <pre>
                const redDice = new Dice();
        result:  Dice { sides: 6, roll: [Function] }
            </pre>

            instanceof operator can be used to check if something is an instance of a class:
            <pre>
                redDice instanceof Dice
        result: true
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>ES6 Class Declaration</h3>
        <p>
            ES6 introduced more class-like syntax for declaring a class:
            <pre>
                class Dice {
                    constructor(sides=6) {
                        this.sides = sides;
                    }
                    roll() {
                        return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                    }
                }
            </pre>
            It can act jut like the constructor function syntax, but it's easier to read and 
            the code in a class definition is implicitly in strict mode even without the 'use strict' statement.
            Another benefit is that it throws an error when called without the new operator, which would before
            just be hard to track down.
        </p>

        <h3>The constructor property</h3>
        <p> The constructor property returns the constructor function that created it.
            This can be used to call an unknown constructor to make a copy of an object:
            <pre>
                const greenDice = new redDice.constructor(10);
                greenDice instanceOf Dice
    result:     true
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Static Methods</h3>
        <p>
            The static keyword can be added to class declarations. Static methods are called by the class rather 
            than by instances of the class.
            <br>Example declaration of static method:
            <pre>
                class Dice {
                    constructor(sides=6) {
                        this.sides = sides;
                    }
                    roll() {
                        return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
                    }
                    static description() {
                        return 'A way of choosing random numbers'
                    }
                }
            </pre>
            Calling a static method:
            <pre>
                Dice.description()
    result:     'A way of choosing random numbers'
            </pre>
            Instances of classes cannot call static methods from themselves.
            The class itself is used to call it.
        </p>

        <h3>Prototypal Inheritance</h3>
        <p>
            If you don't have access to the class declaration of a class, but want to augment it with extra
            methods and properties after it has been created you can use the prototype property.
            All classes and constructor function have a prototype property that returns an object:
            <pre>
                Turtle.prototype;
        result: Turtle {}
            </pre>
            New properties and methods can be added to a prototype by assignment because it is an object.
            <pre>
                Turtle.prototype.weapon = 'Hands';

                Turtle.prototype.attack = function(){
                    return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;
                    }
            </pre>
            Any new objects of the same type will inherit the newly added properties and methods of the prototype
            object in addition to what is in the class declaration.
        </p>

        <h3>Finding out the prototype</h3>
        <p>You can call the prototype property to find out the prototype.
            Another option is Object.getPrototypeOf() method, accepting the object as a parameter.
            There is also an isPrototypeOf() method that returns a boolean. setPrototypeOf() method can 
            set the prototype of an object.
        </p>

        <h3>Own properties and prototype properties</h3>
        <p>
            hasOwnProperty() method can be used to check if a property is an object's own or if it is inherited from a prototype.
            Prototype properties are shared by every instance of the same class. The value is found in one place in memory, so it is efficient. It is good for properties
            that need to be the same.
        </p>

        <h3>The Prototype is Live</h3>
        <p>
            Because the prototype object is live, if a new property or method is added to the prototype then 
            any instances of its class will inherite the new properties and methods automatically, even if that instance 
            has already been created.
        </p>

        <h3>Own Properties</h3>
        <p>
            Any properties or methods inherited from a prototype can be overwrited by assigning a new value 
            to them. The property will become an 'own property' of the instance object. It will take precedence over the same prototype property when used in methods.

        </p>

        <h3>What to use the prototype for?</h3>

        <p>
            Methods are useful to add to a prototype because different instances will likely use the same ones. If values are different 
            for a property then it does not need to be in the prototype.
        </p>

        <h3>Public and Private</h3>
        <p>
            Public properties and methods can be changed, but private properties and methods
            cannot be accessed from outside the class itself. This means that they are accessed using getter and setter methods.
        </p>

        <h3>Prototype chain</h3>
        <p>
            If an object doesn't have the method that is called then its prototype is checked. Down the prototype chain is checked until
            the object constructor is found at the end of the prototype chain. Creating objects from other objects will create a prototype chain.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Enumerable Properties
        </h3>
        <p>
            Enumerable properties will show up in a for-in loop, which loops through an object's properties and methods.
            Non-enumerable properties don't show up.
            <br><br>
            propertyIsEnumberable() is a method that every object has, and can be used to check if a property is enumerable.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's good practice for built-in methods to be non-enumerable, and any user-defined methods to be made enumerable.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Inheritance using extends
        </h3>
        <p>
            Keyword extends can be used for a class to inherit from another class.
            Inside the child class declaration the keyword super refers to the parent class. It can access any properties and call any methods of the 
            parent class. 
        </p>

        <h3>Mixins</h3>
        <p>
            The Object.assign() method provides basic mixin functionality. But only a shallow copy is made, so arrays and nested 
            objects won't be mixed in properly. 

            <pre>
                const a = {};
const b = { name: 'JavaScript' };
Object.assign(a,b);
result: { name: 'JavaScript' }
a.name
result: 'JavaScript'
            </pre>

            A mixin Function can be made to properly transfer things:
            <pre>
                function mixin(target,...objects) {
                    for (const object of objects) {   
                    if(typeof object === 'object') {
                        for (const key of Object.keys(object)) {
                            if (typeof object[key] === 'object') {
                            target[key] = Array.isArray(object[key]) ? [] : {};
                            mixin(target[key],object[key]);
                            } else {
                            Object.assign(target,object);  
                            }
                        }
                        }
                    }
                    return target;
                }
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Binding this</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes this will refernce the global window object, often resulting in undefined values when in 
            nested objects rather than what you want to use. 
            You can set that equal to this and use that in its place.
            <br><br>
            bind(this) sets the value of this in the function.
            <pre>
                superman.findFriends = function() {
                    this.friends.forEach(function(friend) {
                        console.log(`${friend.name} is friends with ${this.name}`);
                    }.bind(this);)
                }
                
            </pre>

            for-of could be used instead of forEach because it doesn't require a nested object.
        </p>
