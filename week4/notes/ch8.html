        <h2>Chapter 8: Forms</h2>
        <p>
            Forms accept information that can be sent to a backend server using PHP or Ruby.
            You can also process the information before sending it to the server using JavaScript.

        </p>
        
        <h2>Accessing Form Elements</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>document.forms is a property that returns an HTML collection of 
                    all of the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            document.forms[0] returns the first form object in the document.
                        </li>
                        <li>document.getElementsByTagname('form') is equivalent to document.forms.</li>
                        <li>The name attribute can be used to identify a form in place of the numerical index.
                            document.forms.search; However if the form has the same name as any properties or methods of the document.forms object 
                            then that property or method would be referenced insteaed of the form element. Square bracket notation can be used instead to 
                            avoid this. document.forms['search'];
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A form object has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form.
                    <br>If a form has an input and a button, for example:
                    <br> const [input, button] = form.elements;
                </li>
                <li>Form controls can be accessed through their names. If the input field's name was searchInput:<br>
                    form.searchInput;
                    <br>Or square bracket notation:
                    <br> form['searchInput'];
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Form Properties and Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>form.submit() will submit a form automatically.</li>
            <li>form.reset() will reset all of the form controls back to their initial values specificed in the HTML.
                Buttons with the type reset can do this without the need for additional scripting.
            </li>
            <li>form.action property can be used to set the action attributed. The URL on the server where the form needs to be
                sent for procssing is what it should be set to.
                <br> form.action = '/an/other.url'
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submitting a Form</h2>
        <p>Intercept a submit button by adding an event listener for submit
            with the following code:
            <pre>
                const form = document.forms['search'];
                form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false);
                function search() {
                    alert(' Form Submitted');
                }
            </pre>
            With this code the form will still be submitted to the url. Use preventDefault()
            to stop that from happening. Add it to the search function:
            <pre>
                function search(event) {
                    alert('Form Submitted');
                    event.preventDefault();
                }
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Accessing input</h2>
        <p>
            Accessing what is in an input takes the following form:
            <br> input.value <br>
            This can return a value or assignment can be used to put a value in it.
            <br>
            The following code shows how to do hint text for an input by using the focus and blur events:
            <pre>
                input.addEventListener('focus', function(){
                    if (input.value==='Search Here') {
                        input.value = '' 
                    }
                }, false);
                input.addEventListener('blur', function(){
                    if(input.value === '') {
                        input.value = 'Search Here';
                    } }, false);
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Form Controls</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>input fields including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads.
                    <ul>
                        <li>text input fields: text is the default value for input type. Use type='text' to make the purpose of the field explicit.</li>
                        <li>Password input fields: type='password' is used to enter passwords or secret information. The characters are concealed as soon as they are on screen.</li>
                        <li>Checkbox input fields: type='checkbox' used to select different options that can be checked true or false. User can select more than one checkbox in a list.
                            Boxes can be checked initially using the 'checked' attribute in HTML.
                        </li>
                        <li>Radio button input fields: type='radio' like checkedboxes but only allow one option to be true in a group that has the same Name
                            attribute.</li>
                        <li>
                            Hidden input fields: type='hidden' are not displayed by the browser. Can be used to send information like settings or information that the user has already 
                            provided. It will by sent with this form's action attribute. Can be found in HTML, so they should not be used for sensitive information.
                        </li>
                        <li>File input fields: type='file' can be used to upload files. Most broswers provide a browse button or similar that lets a user select a
                            file from their file system.
                        </li>
                        <li>Other input types: HTML5 supports new input types such as number, tel, and color.
                            These will validate automatically, and different browsers will implement different 
                            UI elements to let users select these. Currently, browsers that do not support these will use 
                            normal text-input fields in their place, so there is no risk to using them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>select menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
                <li>textarea elements for longer text entry</li>
                <li>button elements for submitting and resetting forms.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Submit type to submit a form according to its action attribute.</li>
                        <li>Reset type to clear all form elements. Resets to default values.</li>
                        <li>button type to just be a clickable button that an event listener can be attached to.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Form Validation</h2>
        <p>
            Form validation can happen on client side or server side. Both should be used. It is possible to bypass front-end validation 
            and send arbitrary data to the server side, so only secure server side validation should be trusted. Client side validation is 
            good for providing good user experience.
            <br>
            Adding the 'required' attribute in HTML5 will keep a form from being submitted unless the form element has a value selected.
