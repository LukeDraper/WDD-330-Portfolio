        <h2>Ch: Modern Javascript Development</h2>
        <p>
            Libraries are used to make things easier to implement and reduce the amount of code written for common
            tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>
            jQuery 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The most popular of all JavaScript libraries used today.
            It makes it much easier to support older browsers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Libraries</h3>
        <p>
            Advantages<br>
            Popular libraries are optimized and battle tested for nearly every eventuality.
            It will support more things, and there will be a community that can answer your questions.
            <br><br>
            Disadvantages<br>
            You have to include the code of the library, so more code is required total. It can slow down loading your code. They might also fail to
            implement a functionality the way that you need it. Using plain JavaScript can be much faster than a library, but this is not noticeable in most 
            situations.

        </p>

        <h3>Using A Library</h3>
        <p>
            <li>
                Avoid "Here today. Gone tomorrow" libraries.
            </li>
            <li>Avoid feature bloat. If you aren't using enough of the library it may not be worth it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you understand the JavaScript</li>
            <li>Libraries should speed up development.</li>
        </p>

        <h3>Modular JavaScript Added in ES6</h3>
        <p>
            Modules are self-contained pieces of code that provide functions and methods that can be used in other files 
            and modules. They have a single purpose. Keeping code modular makes 
            it easy to swap them out as needed and include the minimum needed code. Also avoid writing the same code multiple times.
            <br><br>
            All code in modules is always in strict mode, have their own global scope. 
            this in the top-level of a module is undefined, rather than a global object. 
            HTML style comments aren't allowed.
            <br>
            <br>
            The keyword export specifies values or function to be made available from the module. Not everything in it needs to be used.
            <br>
            <br>
            Exporting functions example:
            <pre>
                function square(x) {
                    return x * x;
                }
                function sum(array, callback) {
                    if(callback) {
                        array = array.map(callback);
                    }
                    return array.reduce((a,b) => a + b );
                }
                function variance(array) {
                    return sum(array,square)/array.length - square(mean(array))
                }
                function mean(array) {
                    return sum(array) / array.length;
                }
                export {
                    variance,
                    mean
                }
            </pre>
            Importing functions example:
            <pre>
                import  { mean, variance } from './stats.js';

                or for all

                import * as stats from './stats.js';
            </pre>
            You can select just what you want from a module file.
        </p>

        <h3>Default Exports</h3>
        <p>
            Each module gets one default export that can be imported withot having to be explicitly named. Objects, functions, variables, or classes can be exported. 
            Syntax:
            <pre>
                const PI = 3.145926;
                export default PI;
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Node.js Modules Using Common JS modules Notation</h3>
        <p>
            A Common JS module is created in a separate file. The module.exports method is used to make functions available
            to other files. Example:
            <pre>
                module.exports = x =>  x * x;

            // Required in another file by the following line.
            const square = require('./squareFunction');

            </pre>

        </p>

        <h3>Model, View, Controller Frameworks</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Model: objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting.
                    Holds the information about an application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Views: The visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Controllers: link the modesl and views together by communicating between them. Responds to events to process information and
                    update the model and view as needed.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </p>
