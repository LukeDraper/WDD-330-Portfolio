        <h2>Chapter 13: AJAX</h2>
        <p>JavaScript as a client-side scripting language uses AJAX to asynchronously request data from the server. This data is usually snippets of html 
            or text. It used to used the XMLHttpRequest object, but that has since been replaced by the fetch api.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Fetch API
        </h3>
        <p>
            Fetch only has one mandatory argument: the URL of the resource you need. Here's the structure of using fetch:
            <pre>
                const url = 'https:example.com/data';
                fetch(url)
                .then((response) => {
                    if(response.ok) {
                        return response;
                    }
                    throw Error(response.statusText);
                })
                .then( response => // do something with response )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )
            </pre>
            The response object needs to be checked because there could be a 404 error or some other kind. A network error will be result 
            in a broken promise, but the promise is successful if the destination returns a response. The response object has some properties including:
            <ul>
                <li>statusText: specifies the status message that corresponds to the code returned.</li>
                <li>headers: A Headers object containing any headers associated with the response.</li>
                <li>url: A string containing the url of the response.</li>
                <li>redirected: a boolean value that specifies if the response if the result of a redirect.</li>
                <li>type: A string value of 'basic', 'cors', 'error', or 'opaque'
                    <ul>
                        <li>'basic' means response is the from the same domain.</li>
                        <li>'cors' means data was received from a valid cross-origin request from a different domain.</li>
                        <li>'opaque' is used for a 'no-cors' request from another domain, so access to the data will be severely restricted.</li>
                        <li>'error' used for when a network error occurs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Redirects ---- Not supported by any browser at this time.</h4>
        <p>
            The redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to the response from the redirected URL.
            <pre>
                fetch(url)
                .then( response => response.redirect(newURL)); // redirects to another URL
                .then( // do something else )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Text Responses</h4>
        <p>
            text() method called from the response like response.text(). It takes a stream of text from the response, reads it, and 
            returns a promise that resolves to a USVSting object that JavaScript can treat as a string.
        </p>

        <h4>File Responses</h4>
        <p>
            The blob() method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet. Once it has read the whole file, it returns a promise that resolves with a blob object.
            <pre>
                fetch(url)
                .then( response => response.blob() ); // transforms the data into a blob object
                .then( blob => console.log(blob.type) )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
            </pre>
            The blob() method returns a blob object, and the type of that object is logged in the example.
        </p>

        <h4>JSON Responses</h4>
        <p>
            JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses. The json() method converts the JSON data to a javascript object.
            The Object.entries() method can be used to view the key and value pairs in the object.
            <pre>
                fetch(url)
                .then( response => response.json() ); // transforms the JSON data into a JavaScript object
                .then( data => console.log(Object.entries(data)) )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Creating Response Objects</h4>
        <p>
            You can create your own response objects with the following syntax:
            <pre>
                const response = new Response( 'Hello!', {
                    ok: true,
                    status: 200,
                    statusText: 'OK',
                    type: 'cors',
                    url: '/api'
                });
            </pre>
            The first argument is the data to be returned and the second can specify values for properties of the response object.
            
        </p>

        <h4>
            Request Objects
        </h4>
        <p>
            Request objects can be created to give more control over the request. 
            Example:
            <pre>
                const request = new Request('https://example.com/data', {
                    method: 'GET',
                    mode: 'cors',
                    redirect: 'follow',
                    cache: 'no-cache'
                });
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>
            Headers Interface
        </h4>
        <p>
            HTTP Headers are used to pass additional information about a request or response. Headers most often contain 
            the file-type of the resource, cookie information, and when the resource was last modified.
            <pre>
                const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Accept-Charset' : 'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip,deflate' })
            </pre>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Putting Headers, requests, and reponse objects together</h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
                const url = 'https:example.com/data';
                const headers = new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain', 'Accept-Charset' : 'utf-8', 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip,deflate' })
                const request = (url,{
                    headers: headers
                })
                fetch(request)
                .then( function(response) {
                    if(response.ok) {
                        return response;
                    }
                    throw Error(response.statusText);
                })
                .then( response => // do something with response )
                .catch( error => console.log('There was an error!') )
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Sending Information</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>When sending information to a database you need to use a POST request.</ul>
            
            Form objects have properties of action and method that can be used to create an AJAX request.
            <pre>
                const request = new Request(form.action,
                {
                    method: form.method,
                    header: headers,
                    body: data
                }
                )
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>FOrmData</h4>
        <p>
            The fetch api has the FormData interface to make it easier to submit information in forms using AJAX.
            <pre>
                const form = document.forms['todo'];
                
                form.addEventListener('submit', addTask, false);

                function addTask(event) {
                    event.preventDefault();
                    const task = new FormData(form);
                    const url = `http://echo.jsontest.com/id/1/title/${form.task.value}`;
                    const headers = new Headers({
                        'Accept': 'application/json',
                        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                    });
                    const request = new Request(url,
                    {
                        method: 'POST',
                        mode: 'cors',
                        header: headers,
                        body: JSON.stringify(task)
                    }
                    )

                    fetch(request)
                    .then( response => response.json() )
                    .then( data => console.log(`${data.title} saved with an id of ${data.id}`) )
                    .catch( error => console.log('There was an error:', error))
                }
            </pre>
            FormData creates the task object. It also automatically creates the necessary settings required to handle 
            files. Use FormData if files are accepted through the form because it's difficult or may require third-party libraries.
            <br><br>

            Data can be added to the form data instance as key-value pairs using the append() method:
            <pre>
                data = new FormData(); // no form provided as an argument creates an empty form data instance
                data.append('height', 75);
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>
            A Living Standard
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Fetch API is currently a "living standard", meaning that development is currently ongoing. It's available to use,
            but it may change as feedback is provided by its users. Living standards tend to be pretty stable, especially in the case of 
            Fetch which has been implemented in almost all current browsers. 
            <br><br>
            Libraries that take care of Ajax requests may use the most up-to-date methods, taking care of the changes to standards for you.
            jQuery for example has a generic ajax() method that can be used like the fetch() method.
