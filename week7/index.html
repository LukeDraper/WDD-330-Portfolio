        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Why is it important for a function to be pure? Should I still have some impure functions depending on need?</li>
            <li>Are there any programming paradigms that JavaScript doesn't or can't use? I believe ES6(?) added a lot of the Object-oriented features.</li>
            <li>What causes browsers not to support features? Is it that they are hard to implement or do browsers also avoid features that they don't think are 
                good?
