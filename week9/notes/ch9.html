        <h2>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h2>
        <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
        <p>
            The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the 
            browser and computer screen. 
        </p>
        <h4>The Window As the Global Object</h4>
        <p>
            In a browser environment global variables are properties of the window object. So window.x is the same 
            as calling the global variable x. Usually you shouldn't refer to global variables using the window object.
            Some methods like parseInt() and isNaN are methods of the global object. 
        </p>

        <h4>Dialogs</h4>
        <p>
            Three functions that produce dialogs in browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt() they are not part of the ECMAScript 
            standard, but all major browsers support them as methods of the window object.
            <ul>
                <li>window.alert() pauses execution of the program and displays a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an argument 
                    to the message and undefined is always returned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    window.confirm() stops execution of the program and displays a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument 
                    and giving options of OK or Cancel. It returns a boolean value of true if the user clicks OK and false if the user clicks cancel.

                </li>
                <li>
                    window.prompt() stops execution of the program, and shows a dialog with the message provided as an argument. There is an input field for 
                    the user to enter text. This text is returned if OK is clicked, and null is returned if Cancel is clicked.
                </li>
            </ul>
            These methods can cause problems if the program needs to process something or is waiting for a callback function because it stops 
            processing when it is called. Browsers also allow users to keep these from popping up, so you can't rely on them. 
            But it may be good for double-checking if a user wants to delete a resource or they need to know that a decision needs to be made.
        </p>

        <h4>Browser Information</h4>
        <p>
            window.navigator property returns a reference to the navigator Object, which contains information about the browser being used.
            window.navigator.userAgent property returns information about the browser and operating system used. This is not necessarily reliable
            because the user can modify it to masquerade as a different browser.
        </p>

        <h5>Location Properties</h5>
        <p>
            window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. Differenet properties 
            provide information about different fragments of the URL.
            <ul>
                <li>window.location.href returns the full URL as a string. It is a read/write property, and if changed the page will be reloaded 
                    with the new property. So it can be used to redirect.
                </li>

                <li>
                    window.location.protocol 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
