        <h2>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <h3>The data- attribute</h3>
        <p>
            The data- attribute is a way to embed data in a web page using custom attributes ignored by the browser so that the 
            data can be used by JavaScript.
            The names of the attributes have 3 requirements:
            <ul>
                <li>Start with data-</li>
                <li>COntain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.</li>
                <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
            </ul>
            INformation contained in attributes can be used to identify particular elements(all dropdown menus could have data-dropdown) It can also be used to 
            filter elements (find all elements with a data-rating of 3 or more). Each element has a dataset property that  can  be used to access all data- attributes.
            <pre>
                <div id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'>
                    Superman
                </div>

                const superman = document.getElementById('hero');
                const powers = superman.dataset.powers;
                << 'flight superSpeed'
            </pre>

            The data- prefix is dropped and the data- attributes act like properties of the dataset object.
            There is a restriction of only using string values, but you can encode JavaScript objects as JSON strings
            and perform type conversion.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
        <p>
            HTML5 has APIs that help to gain access to hardware, like cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card.
        </p>
        <h4>HTML5 Web Storage</h4>
        <p>
            Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer like cookies but with fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and 
            it's generally easier to use. It's good for storing information about users or application specific information.
            <br><br>
            Difference of the Web Storage API from Cookies 
            <ul>
                <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
                <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same)</li>
                <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB for cookies. (No limit in specification, but most browsers 
                    limit to 5GB per domain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentiall makes cookies a better choice for something 
                    like showing a popup once a day.
                </li>
            </ul>
            localStorage and sessionStorage are part of the Web Storage API. Information is saved as strings in key-value pairs.
            Save with: 
            <pre>
                localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');

            get with:

                localStorage.getItem('name'); 
                << "Walter White"

            or use the property version:

                localStorage.name = 'Heisenberg'; 
                console.log(localStorage.name); 
                << "Heisenberg";
            </pre>
            To remove an entry use the removeItem method or the delete operator. Use the localStorage.clear() method 
            to remove everything in localStorage.
            <br><br>
            Everyt time a value is saved to storage an event is fired. Has the following properties
            <ul>
                <li>key tells us the key of the item that changed</li>
                <li>newValue tells us the new value it has been changed to</li>
                <li>oldValue tells us the previous value</li>
                <li>storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        <p>
            Due to privacy concerns, user permission is needed to access geolocation. It can find location, nearby places,
            or measure the speed the user is moving. If geolocation is available it will be a property of the navigator object.
            This property has a method called getCurrentPosition() that will return a position object to a specified callback function 
            <pre>
                navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);
            </pre>
            <h5>navigator.position</h5>
            The position object passed to the callback function has a coords property with a latitude and longitude property.
            It's other properties include:
            <ul>
                <li>position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.</li>
                <li>position.altitude property returns an estimate of the deviceâ€™s altitude in meters above theWGS84ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.</li>
                <li>position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from North.</li>
                <li>position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded.</li>
                <li>position.accuracy method returns the accuracy of longitude and latitude in meters.</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>
            navigator.geolocation.watchPosition() method will call the callback function passed in every time the position 
            is updated. Returns the id of the watch.
            <br><br>
            navigator.geolocation.clearWatch() stops the callback being called using the id of the watch as an argument.
            
        </p>

        <h4>
            Web Workers
        </h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a single-threaded language, but web workers allow processes to be run in the background.
            Use Worker() constructor function to create a new worker.
            <pre>
                const worker = new Worker('task.js');
            </pre>
            The function takes the name of another JavaScript file as an argument. This file will be downloaded asynchronously 
            if it exists. The variable assigned to the worker can be used to refer to the worker in the main program. In the 
            worker script (task.js in the example) self refers to the worker.
            <br><br> 
            The worker object can use the postMessage() method to send a message between the worker and the main script. 
            <pre>
                worker.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
                    console.log(event.data);
                }, false);
            </pre>
            This event listener can be used to listen for and process messages. When the worker script is done 
            either worker.terminate(); or self.close(); can be used to stop the worker.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is possible to have shared web workers 

        </p>

        <h4>
            A Factorizing Example 
        </h4>
        <button id='rainbow'>Change Color</button>
        <form>
            <label for='number'>Enter a Number to Factorize:</label>
            <input id='number' type='number' name='number' min=1 value='20'>
            <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
        </form>
        <div id='output'></div>

        <h4>Service Workers</h4>
        <p>
            Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in background, but with ability to intercept network requests. 
            This allows you to work differently if offline and create app-like offline experiences.
        </p>

        <h4>Websockets</h4>
        <p>
            A new protocol that allows for two-way communication with a server. Also known as push messaging. A connection is 
            kept open and responses are 'pushed' to the client as soon as they are received.
        </p>

        <h4>Websocket Example</h4>
        <form>
            <label for='message'>Enter a Message:</label>
            <input type='text' name='message'>
            <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
        </form>
        <div id='output1'></div>

        <h4>Notifications</h4>
        <p>
            Notifications allow you to show messages using the system's Notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the 
            screen but depends on the operating system. System Notifications will be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current 
            tab. You need permission from the user with the requestPermission() method of a Notification global object before you can send notifications.
            <pre>
                if(window.Notification) {
                    Notification.requestPermission();
                }
            </pre>
            This returns a promise with the permission property of the Notification object set to eiher 'granted' or 'denied'. If it's set to granted, 
            you can create a new notification using a constructor function like so:
            <pre>
                if(window.Notification) {
                    Notification.requestPermission()
                    .then((permission) => {
                        if(Notification.permission === 'granted') {
                        new Notification('Hello JavaScript!');
                        }
                    });
                }
            </pre>
            Notifications are required to have a title passed as their first paremeter. The second parameter is an object of options.
            This includes a body property that specifies the text to appear below the title or an icon that links to an image.
            <pre>
                const notification = new Notification('JavaScript: Novice to Ninja',{
                    body: 'The new book from SitePoint',
                    icon: 'sitepointlogo.png'
                });
            </pre>
            Some browsers and OS's close notifications automatically, but you can also use myNotification.close().
            Event listeners like click can be added to notifications to do things like open a new window.
        </p>

        <h4>Multimedia</h4>
        <p>
            Media API works with audio and video tags to control playback using JavaScript.
            The elements are referenced using DOM methods, and you can use the specific methods from there:
            <pre>
                const video = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0];
            </pre>
            play(), pause(), volume(), muted, currentTime(), playbackRate, loop, and duration are properties and methods of 
            the media objects. play, pause, volumechange, and loadedmetadata are all events associated with these elements.
        </p>

        <h4>Shims and Polyfills</h4>
        <p>
            Shims and polyfills fill in to implement missing functionality for browsers that don't support features. 
            Shims are pieces of code that adds missing functionality to a browser. Polyfills are shims that achieve the same 
            function while also using API commands for if the feature was supported natively.
        </p>
