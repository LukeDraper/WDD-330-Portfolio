        <h3>HTML5's Canvas API</h3>
        <p>
            Using canvas we can draw all sorts of things and avoid the need to download hefty images. The canvas HTML element's 
            inner text only shows up if canvas is not supported by the browser.  Canvas also has a height and width attributed that must
            be set in html. 
            <br><br>
            Once the canvas is set up we do all of the drawing in JavaScript after getting the element from the document. We will then get the context
            which will be in the Cavas RenderingContext2D interface. 
            <pre>
                var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
                var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
            </pre>

            To do 3d graphics you can use the WebGL API.
            
        </p>
        <h4>Filling Brush with Color</h4>
        <p>
            To draw with color you need to set the context's strokeStyle or fillStyle properties with either a string representing a color,
            a CanvasGradient object, or a CanvasPattern object. The color can also use hexadecimal values, rgb, or rgba values.
            The following code will allow for a blue rectangle with a red outline to be drawn:
            <pre>
                var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");     
                var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
                context.strokeStyle = "red";
                context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)";
            </pre>
        </p>
        <canvas id="myCanvas1" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
            Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.
        </canvas>

        <h4>fillStyle with a CanvasPattern</h4>
        <p>
            We can use a CanvasPattern in our fillStyle by using the createPattern method with an image.
            createPattern accepts two parameters: an image and how the image should be repeated as a string value.
            When setting the image src attribute you should set an onload event handler to create the pattern and fill it 
            after the image is ready for use or it may cause errors. The results of createPattern can then be stored in a 
            variable to by passed to fillStyle.
        </p>
        <pre>
            function drawPattern() {
                var canvas = document.getElementById("demo2");
                var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
                context.strokeStyle = "red";
                
                var img = new Image();
                img.src = "../images/bg-bike.png";
                img.onload = function() { 
                    
                var pattern = context.createPattern(img, "repeat"); 
                context.fillStyle = pattern;                        
                context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);                  
                context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);    
                };            
            }  
        </pre>
        
        <canvas id="demo2" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
            Sorry! Your browser doesn’t support Canvas.
        </canvas>

        <h4>
            fillStyle with CanvasGradient
        </h4>
        <p>
            There are 2 methods that can create a CanvasGradient object. createLinearGradient() or createRadialGradient()
            createLinearGradient(x0, y0, x1, y1) x0 and y0 represent the starting location of the gradient. x1 and y1 
            represent the ending location.
            <br><br>
            Once the gradient is created we use gradient.addColorStop(offset, color). The color in the function works just like the 
            colors previously. The offset is a value from 0 to 1. To make a gradient that starts as blue and begins to blend into white
             halfway down the gradient, we can specify a blue color stop with an offset of 0 and a white color stop with an offset of 1. 
             The color stop sets where in the gradient it will be a particular color, so between color stops it will bleed into the colors 
             of the stops on either side.
        </p>

        <h4>Drawing Other Shapes by Creating Paths</h4>
        <p>
            Any shape can be drawn in canvas by laying out the path of the shape. Paths are invisible until 
            they have a stroke or fill. The 3 steps for any shape is to lay out the path, stroke the path, and fill the path.
            To draw a circle you use the arc method and set the angles to draw a full circle.
            The signature for the arc method is: arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise) .
            x and y set where the arc's path begins.
            <br><br>
            Angles in the arc() method are measured in radians.
            <br><br>
            Rather than fillRect and strokeRect just the fill() and stroke methods are used.

        <h4>Saving Canvas Drawings</h4>
        <p>
            To save a canvas drawing you can use the toDataURL function to open a new window with the image in it where you can right click 
            and use "save image as".
        </p>

        <h4>Drawing image to Canvas</h4>
        <p>
            The drawImage() function can be called on the context. It accepts an image and 
            an x and y coordinates to position the image.
        </p>

        <h4>Image Manipulation with Canvas</h4>
        <p>
            getImageData method from the canvas api can be used to manipluate the pixels of the image.
            It returns an ImageData object, which has width, height, and data properties. The data property 
            contains an array of pixels that have 4 values each (rgba) that determine the color and opacity.
        </p>

        <h4>Converting a Color Image to Black and White</h4>
        <p>
            To convert an image to black and white, we can use a for loop to iterate through each pixel and convert it to grayscale.
        </p>

        <h4>Converting Video to Black and White With Canvas</h4>
        <p>
            Converting a video to grayscale works by first creating functions that accept the video element, context, and canvas. 
            While the video is playing, these are used to convert each frame of the video to grayscale and then output it to a canvas overlay.

            This code improves performance by not using imageData.data. Instead the data property is put into a pixelData variable. This saves on 
            performance because property lookups become more costly when they are down as many times is needed for the video.
            <pre>
                function makeVideoOldTimey() {
                    var video = document.getElementById("video");
                    var canvas = document.getElementById("canvasOverlay");
                    var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
                    video.addEventListener("play", function() { 
                    draw(video,context,canvas);               
                    }, false);  
                }

                function draw(video, context, canvas) {
                    if (video.paused || video.ended) return false;
                    
                    drawOneFrame(video, context, canvas);
                }

                function drawOneFrame(video, context, canvas){
                    // draw the video onto the canvas
                    context.drawImage(video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
                    var imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, 
                ↵canvas.height);
                    var pixelData = imageData.data; 
                    // Loop through the red, green and blue pixels, 
                    // turning them grayscale
                    
                    var red, green, blue, greyscale;  
                    for (var i = 0; i < pixelData.length; i += 4) {
                    red = pixelData[i];
                    green = pixelData[i + 1];
                    blue = pixelData[i + 2];
                    //we'll ignore the alpha value, which is in position i+3
                        
                    grayscale = red * 0.3 + green * 0.59 + blue * 0.11;
                        
                    pixelData[i] = grayscale;
                    pixelData[i + 1] = grayscale;
                    pixelData[i + 2] = grayscale;
                    }
                            
                    context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0); 
                }
            </pre>


        </p>

        <h4>Writing Text to Canvas</h4>
        <p>
            Canvas has a fillText method. It accepts a string and two position parameters. Multiple 
            fillTexts methods can be used to place text in various places. Before using fillText you have to 
            set the text color with fillStyle and the alignment with textAlign. You can also set the font as a property like 
            the other 2. 
        </p>

        <h3>SVG</h3>
        <p>
            SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics is a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML. 
            A major selling point of vector graphics is that vector images preserve their quality as they are resized.
            <br><br>
            XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. A markup language is a system meant to annotate text.
        </p>

        <h4>Drawing in SVG</h4>
        <p>
            SVG is easier to draw a circle in than canvas. Result below. Inspect element to see the SVG tags 
            and how it's done. The viewBox attribute defines the starting location, width, and height of the SVG image.

            The circle element defines a circle, with cx and cy the X and Y coordinates of the center of the circle. 
            The radius is represented by r , while fill defines the fill style.
        </p>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 400">
            <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red"/>
        </svg>
        <p>
            You can also draw rectangles and also provide a description within desc tags.
        </p>
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 400 400">
            <desc>Drawing a rectangle</desc>
                <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100"  
                    fill="blue" stroke="red" stroke-width="3"  />  
            
        </svg>

        <p>
            Images can quickly become extremely complicated so you might want to use a vector image editor to make SVG images. 
            Adobe Illustrator is one example. 
            <a href="http://inkscape.org/"> Inkscape is an open source option to make SVG images that can be downloaded here.</a>
        </p>


        <h3>Using the Raphaël Library</h3>
        <p>
            Raphaël is an open-source JavaScript library that makes drawing and animating with SVG easier.
            With a combination of HTML and JavaScript it is able to do things like make a loading icon spin.
        </p>

        <h3>Drag and Drop API</h3>
        <p>
            The drag and drop api lets us specify what elements are draggable and what happens when they are dragged or dropped 
            onto other elements on the page. It can be used for dragging files from computer to web page in combination with the File 
            API. or elements can be dragged on the same page.

            <br><br>
            If you wish to add drag and drop to the page:
            <ol>
                <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable.</li>
                <li>Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements.</li>
                <li>Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept dropped items.</li>
            </ol>
            The draggable attribute needs to be set to "true" explicitly
            
            <h4> The DataTransfer Object </h4>
            DataTransfer objects let us set and get data about objects being dragged.
            Including: 
            <ul>
                <li>type of data we're saving of teh draggable element.</li>
                <li>The value of the data itself.</li>
            </ul>
            This way objects being dragged can be differentiated and move data around the way they are expected to.
            <h4>Accepting Dropped Elements</h4>
            <p>
                The dropped and dragover events allow for more to be done than just drag elements around.
            </p>
        </p>
