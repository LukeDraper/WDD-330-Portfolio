        <h2>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <p>CSS3 allows for animation using transform and Transitions without requiring a single line of JavaScript.</p>
        

        <h3>Transforms</h3>
        <p>Quick facts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transforms don't work on inline elements. Use inline-block to be able to use them on elements such as spans.</li>
            <li>Multiple transform functions can be used in a space-separated list. Otherwise one transform will override the other.</li>
            <li>Filters can be used to support IE 8 and earlier, but the code is ugly and performs poorly.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4 class="translate">Translate</h4>
        <p>Translation functions move elements without impacting the flow of the document. Translated elements are moved relative to their current position.
            Example:
        </p>
        <pre class="translate">
            transform: translate(45px, -45px);
        </pre>
        <p>
            IE9 and older mobile Webkit browsers require the following vendor prefixing to make transforms work:
        </p>
        <pre>
            -webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android 
            ↵4.4.3, BB10 */
            -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */
            transform: translate(45px,-45px);
        </pre>
        <br><br>
            translateX() and translateY() are axis-specific versions of the function.
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <h4 class="scaled">Scaling</h4>

        <p>
            The scale(x,y) function scales an element both horzontally or vertically.
            It's dimensions are multiply by the provided values. If only one value is provided then it will
            be used for both horizontal and vertical values. One value will scale. Two different values will distort.
            Values with an absolute value less than one will make the element slower.
            <br><br>
            Scaling has no impact on document flow, so text will not account for it by reflowing.
            <br><br>
            scaleX() and scaleY() are axis-specific versions of the function.
            <h4 class='scale'>This element gets transform: scale(3, 0.75) translate(5, 0); on hover.</h4>
        </p>

        <h4>Rotation</h4>
        <p>
            rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. 
            Default point of origin is always center. Positive degrees results in a clockwise rotation, while
            negative degrees result in a counterclockwise rotation.
        </p>
        <h4>Skew</h4>
        <h4 class="skewed">Skewed Heading is after the "Skew" heading in html.</h4>
        <p>
            skew() works like rotate, but instead cause a skew to be applied.
            <br><br>
            skewX() and skewY() are axis-specific versions of the function.
        </p>

        <h4>Changing the origin of the Transform</h4>
        <p>
            The transform-origin property can be used to change the point of origin from which the transforms are applied.
            It has the same syntax as the background-position property. The default value is 50% 50% which is center. Values like 
            top center or other percentage values can also be supplied.
        </p>

        <h4>Order Matters</h4>
        <p>
            The order of transform functions is important because they have an effect on each other. Rotate also rotates the axis that 
            translate uses to move, so it is important to take that into account to put things where you want them.
        </p>

        <h3>Transitions</h3>
        <p>
            CSS transitions require very little client side processing, so they work well for even mobile devices.
            They essentially allow CSS properties to change over time allowing for simple animation.
            <br>
            Steps to create a simple transition with only CSS:
            <ol>
                <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
                <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
                <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay . We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
            </ol>
            The -webkit- vendor prefix is still need for older mobile devices.

            <br><br>
            <h4>Transition Properties</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>transition-property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transition. Default is all. Multiple items should be comma separated.
                    <pre>
                        .ad-ad2 h1 span {
                            -webkit-transition-property: -webkit-transform, color;
                            transition-property: transform, color;
                        }
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>transition-duration property is the duration of time to go from default state to the transitioned state. 
                    This can either be specified in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). 200ms or 0.2s is considered to be the optimum
                    time for a transition. Slower is annoying, faster doesn't won't be a noticeable animation.
                </li>
                <li>transition-timing-function controls the pace of the transition. Linear is default, but ther is also ease, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out.
                    These all change the pacing of the transition. ease starts slow, speeds up, and ends slowly.
                    <br><br>
                    The cubic-bezier function lets you define your own timing function. Linear is the same as cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1). The following explanation oversimplifies the function. More calculus needed.
                    The website <a href='http://cubic-bezier.com/'>http://cubic-bezier.com/</a> demonstrates how the 4 numbers in the function works like two pairs of 
                    points in a 1 by 1 graph where x is the time and y is the progress to the transition's completion. These points modify a line on that graph to curve such that the 
                    way the line progresses to the end changes. The default timing functions all stay within the graph, but some interesting timing functions can result 
                    from larger or negative numbers in the y dimension. Messing with the x dimension of the timing function seems to break it maybe.

                    <a href="http://estelle.github.io/animation/files/cubicbezierprint.html">http://estelle.github.io/animation/files/cubicbezierprint.html</a>

                </li>
                <li>transition-delay property accepts a delay specified in seconds s or milliseconds ms. 
                    This is the delay from when the transition is triggered to when it starts. Negative delay will start the transition Immediately,
                    but it will jump through according to the amount of time in the negative transition. At the end of the transition when it starts to transition back 
                    to the start it will jump again.
                </li>
                <li>transition shorthand property takes the other 4 properties in one. 
                    <pre>
                        .ad-ad2 h1 span {
                            transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
                        }
                    </pre>
                    They can be in any order except if delay is included a duration needs to be as well, and duration needs to come before delay.
                </li>

            </ul>

        </p>
         <h4>
             Multiple Transitions
         </h4>
         <p>
             Multiple transitions can happen in one call. The propertys to be transitioned all need to be included in the transition-property property. 
             Different transition values can be applied to each one by comma-separating the values in the same order.
             <pre>
                transition-property: transform, color; 
                transition-duration: 0.2s, 0.1s;  
                transition-timing-function: ease-out, linear;
                transition-delay: 50ms;
             </pre>
             The transition shorthand property can accept a comma-separated list of shorthand:
             <pre>
                transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms;
             </pre>

             If the all keyword is used then the transitions will use the same properties.
             <br><br>
             A transitionend event will fire for each property at the end of their transition.

         </p>

         <div class='transition-example'>
            <h2>Here's an example of a transition</h2>
            <p>
                We can use this little block to show it off. Hover to see it.
            </p>
        </div>

         <h3>Animations</h3>
         <p>
             CSS animations let you control each step of the animation using keyframes.
             CSS animations are lightweight. Good for simple-state changes on mobile. Intricate, stateful UIs should 
             use a JavaScript animation library for manageability and performance.
         </p>

         <h4>Keyframes</h4>
         <p>
             To animate in CSS you create a named animation and then attach it to an element in that elemnts's 
             property declaration block.
             <pre>
                @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { 
                    /* put animation keyframes here */
                }
                @keyframes myAnimation { 
                    /* put animation keyframes here */
                }
             </pre>
             Each keyframe is like a nexted CSS declaration block, but htey use percentage values that may or may not be in a comma-separated list.
             There are to keyterms - from and to - which evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively.
             The properties you want to animate are to be put inside each keyframe with the animated values. They will be smoothly interpolated by the 
             browser's animation engine between each keyframe.
         </p>

         <h4>Animation Properties</h4>
         <p>
             Animation properties also need a second declaration with the webkit prefix to support webkit browsers. 
             <ul>
                <li>animation-name property attaches an animation that has been defined and named using the @keyframes syntax.</li>
                <li>animation-duration specifies duration in seconds or milliseconds.</li>
                <li>animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration. The options are the same as for 
                    transition-timing-function : ease , linear , ease-in , ease-out , ease-in-out ,
                     a developer-defined cubic-bezier() function, step-start , step-end , or a developer-defined number of steps with the steps(number, direction) function.</li>
                <li>animation-iteration-count: the number of times that the animation will play through. Defaults to 1. 
                    infinite can be used as a values. Values with a decimal will cause the animation to stop partway through.
                </li>
                <li>
                    animation-direction: normal; is the default value for animation direction. This means it goes from 0% to 100% before jumping back to 0% to start again. 
                    The reverse values takes that from 100% to 0%. alternate will do normal and then reverse alternately without jumping around. alternate-reverse is like 
                    alternate, but it starts with reverse.
                </li>
                <li>
                    animation-delay the wait before the animation begins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    animation-fill-mode determies what happens before the first animation begins and after the last one ends.
                    <ul>
                        <li>default value is none.</li>
                        <li>backwards has it wait on the first keyframe until the end of the animation delay.</li>
                        <li>forwards has it wait on the last keyframe.</li>
                        <li>both applies forwards and backwards</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    animation-play-state property defines whether the animation is running or paused. 
                    This allows a simple way to control CSS animations from CSS or Javascript.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Shorthand animation property 
                    <pre>
                        .verbose {
                            animation-name: appearDisappear; 
                            animation-duration: 300ms; 
                            animation-timing-function: ease-in;
                            animation-iteration-count: 1;
                            animation-direction: alternate;
                            animation-delay: 5s;
                            animation-fill-mode: backwards;
                            animation-play-state: running;
                        }
                        /* shorthand */
                        .concise {
                            animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;
                        }
                    </pre>
                    Note that in the shorthand version, we’ve left out the animation-iteration-count and animation-play-state since both were set to default.
                    <br><br>
                    If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name . You want to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such as forwards , running , or alternate.
                    
                </li>
             </ul>

             Multiple animations on an element are declared in the animation shortand by including a grouping for each animation name. Each 
             grouping is comma-separated.
             <pre>
                .target {
                    animation: 
                    animationOne 300ms ease-in backwards, 
                    animationTwo 600ms ease-out 1s forwards;
                }
             </pre>
         </p>

        <div class='animation-example'>
            <h2>Here's an example of a animation</h2>
            <p>
                We can use this little block to show it off. It'll disappear and reappear.
            </p>
        </div>
