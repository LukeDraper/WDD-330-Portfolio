        <h2>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
        <p>CSS3 allows for animation using transform and Transitions without requiring a single line of JavaScript.</p>
        

        <h3>Transforms</h3>
        <p>Quick facts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transforms don't work on inline elements. Use inline-block to be able to use them on elements such as spans.</li>
            <li>Multiple transform functions can be used in a space-separated list. Otherwise one transform will override the other.</li>
            <li>Filters can be used to support IE 8 and earlier, but the code is ugly and performs poorly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Translate</h4>
        <p>Translation functions move elements without impacting the flow of the document. Translated elements are moved relative to their current position.
            Example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            transform: translate(45px, -45px);
        </pre>
        <p>
            IE9 and older mobile Webkit browsers require the following vendor prefixing to make transforms work:
        </p>
        <pre>
            -webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android 
            â†µ4.4.3, BB10 */
            -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */
            transform: translate(45px,-45px);
        </pre>
        <br><br>
            translateX() and translateY() are axis-specific versions of the function.

        <h4>Scaling</h4>
        <p>
            The scale(x,y) function scales an element both horzontally or vertically.
            It's dimensions are multiply by the provided values. If only one value is provided then it will
            be used for both horizontal and vertical values. One value will scale. Two different values will distort.
            Values with an absolute value less than one will make the element slower.
            <br><br>
            Scaling has no impact on document flow, so text will not account for it by reflowing.
            <br><br>
            scaleX() and scaleY() are axis-specific versions of the function.
        </p>

        <h4>Rotation</h4>
        <p>
            rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. 
            Default point of origin is always center. Positive degrees results in a clockwise rotation, while
            negative degrees result in a counterclockwise rotation.
        </p>

        <h4>Skew</h4>
        <p>
            skew() works like rotate, but instead cause a skew to be applied.
            <br><br>
            skewX() and skewY() are axis-specific versions of the function.
        </p>

        <h4>Changing the origin of the Transform</h4>
        <p>
            The transform-origin property can be used to change the point of origin from which the transforms are applied.
            It has the same syntax as the background-position property. The default value is 50% 50% which is center. Values like 
            top center or other percentage values can also be supplied.
        </p>

        <h4>Order Matters</h4>
        <p>
            The order of transform functions is important because they have an effect on each other. Rotate also rotates the axis that 
            translate uses to move, so it is important to take that into account to put things where you want them.
        </p>
