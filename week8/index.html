        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When using the cubic-bezier function, why do the 1st and 3rd parameters need to be withing 0 and 1?
                Is it because that axis relates to time while negative progress toward the goal is possible on the other axis?
                Probably too much of a deep dive into calculus is needed to be worth it. Might look into it anyway.
            </li>
            <li>Is canvas widely used?</li>
        </ul>
