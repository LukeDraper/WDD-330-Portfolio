        <h2>Master Mobile UX Notes</h2>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Mobile First UX</h3>
        <p> When designing a website we should design for the smallest,
            least powerful device first. It is important to design for mobile devices
            because many users will use mobile devices to access websites. Mobile devices
            are also replaced more often than desktops or laptops. People may also have multiple 
            devices in their househould.
            <br>
            "Whatever you are doing do mobile first." <br>
            -Eric Schmidt
            <br><br>
            Mobile first should be done rather than doing "responsive retrofitting." 
            Mobile first addresses constraints on mobile devices and prepares for growth.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Things to remember</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011.</li>
                <li>You don't see people with their heads in laptops</li>
                <li>Start small and scale up. (Things grow better than they squish down.</li>
                <li>Mobile is not a fad.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Understanding Users</h3>
        <p>
            "It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times,
            people don't know what they want until you show it to them."
            <br> -Steve Jobs - Apple 
            <br><br>

            Remember Immediate, Relevant, and Frictionless.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediate means that you need to be there. Users can't use what doesn't currently exist.</li>
                <li>
                    Relevant means that you need to be useful. If you can't meet users' needs then they have no reason to stay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Frictionless means that you need to be quick. Users don't want to wait or fight with your UI.
                    If users don't have to do something then automate it and don't make users do it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                In a mobile device, how far a user has to reach to get something is important.
                <br>
                Any load times at all on websites result in lowered retention and revenue.
                Many people don't have the fastest speeds immediately either, so you can't 
                take advantage of fast speeds.
                
                <h4>Increase Speed</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce image usage</li>
                    <li>SVG/Webfonts use less bandwidth</li>
                    <li>Reduce the size of CSS and JS files</li>
                    <li>GZIP files eliminate unnecessary data</li>
                </ul>

            </p>


            <h3>Step 3: Strategic Menu Design</h3>
            <p>
                "The trouble with software is.. it sucks. That's not a nice thing to say..
                but it is a fundamental truth. Software customers -- you, me, CIOs of multibillion-dollar 
                companies...have learned to live with mediocre software. We do not count on software to be 
                intuitively easy to understand or to work consistently. Instead, we make do."
                <br> -Stewart Alsop, Venture Capitalist
                <br><br>
                <h4>How do we make website better for our users?</h4>
                <p>
                    The most commonly used functions should be the easiest to reach. Placing things 
                    where they are easier to reach does these things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            users can reach things now
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            users think your app is faster now
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users engage with your app more
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            User satisfaction increases
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    The hamburger menu is used everywhere, but many users don't know what it is.
                    Adding the word menu with the word menu as a button with a border around it results in more 
                    users clicking the button than if the hamburger menu is used at all. 

                </p>
            </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Step 4: Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h3>
        <p>
            "[The constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, simplified solutions. You can only fit 
            so much on the screen, people often have to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give you their full 
            attention. So make it easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first. Mobile is a great
            forcing function for simplicity."
            <br>
            -Luke Wroblewski, Co-founder of Polar and Bagcheck
            <br><br>
            Special attention needs to be paid to making forms mobile friendly.
            Scrolling off the page should be avoided. Avoid making the page cramped.
            Use buttons sized for being pressed with fingers. You can break up forms by
            using multiple pages with a progress bar.
            <b>Autocomplete should be enable on your forms to reduce the need to actually type things in.</b>
            <br>
            Masking passwords increases typos, and does little to increase security.
            <br>
            "Typically, masking passwords doesn't even increase security, but it does cost you business due to 
            login failures."
            <br> -Nielsen Norman Group
            <br><br>
            You can show passwords by default, but keep the option to hide them for those who want it.
            <h4>Number Fields</h4>
            <p>Space out numbers automatically for readability. Advance users from one number form element
                to the next automatically if there are a set amount of digits. Make it clear which number they need to enter.
                <br>
                Make sure you give users the number pad on mobile when they need it.
                <br><br>
                Link telephone numbers in an anchor tag, so users can call with just one tap on mobile.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5: Mobile Advertising</h3>
        <p>
            "End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently marketers need to stay
            abreast not only of technological developments but also of the way people respond to them."
            <br> -Matt Haig, Author
            <br><br>
            Web advertising often still uses ads designed for desktop sizes.
            <br>
            Pop-ups are detested on the web. Don't use them. It should not be used because nobody likes it. Massive ads in the 
            way of content are also obnoxious. Creative ways to present ads that don't annoy users can get attention 
            through making users curious and interested.
