        <h2>Ch6: Document Object Model Notes</h2>
        <h3>
            What is the DOM?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) represents an html document as a network of connected
            nodes that form tree-like structure. The DOM treats everything on the web page as a node.
            The HTML tag is the root node.
            <br><br>
            The DOM is not part of JavaScript because it is language agnostic, but
            Javascript is still the language most commonly used with it.

        </p>
        <h3>Getting Elements</h3>
        <p>
            There are methods to access any element on a page through the DOM.
            These methods return a nod object or a node list, which is an array-like object.
            <pre>
                const body = document.body;
            </pre>
            Access the document body. This is a Node object with properties and methods we can use
            to find out more about or modify the body element. 
            <br><br>
            nodeType property can tell us the kind of node. It returns a number. Here are the 
            meanings of some of the numbers:
            <ul>
                <li>1 : element</li>
                <li>2: attribute</li>
                <li>3: text</li>
                <li>8: comment</li>
                <li>9: body</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Legacy DOM Shortcut Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Document.body returns the body element of a web page.</li>
                <li>Document.images returns a node list of all the images contained in the document.</li>
                <li>Document.links returns a node list of all the anchor elements and area element that hava
                    an href attribute.
                </li>
                <li>Document.anchors returns a node list of all the anchor elements that have a name attribute.</li>
                <li>Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <h3>Getting Elements</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    document.geteElementById(); This method is probably the most commonly used to access elements on a 
                    web page. If no element has the ID provided then null is returned.
                </li>
                <li>const listItems = document.getElementsByTagName('li');
                    This method gets a node list of all elements with the tag named
                    that is provided as an argument.
                </li>
                <li>getElementsByClassName() returns a live node list of all elements that have the class name that 
                    is supplied as an argument.
                </li>
            </ul>
          
        </p>

        <h3>Query Selectors</h3>
        <p>
            document.queryselector() allows you to use CSS notation to find the first element in the document
            that matches the CSS selector that is the argument.
            <br><br>
            document.querySelectorAll() returns a node list of all the elements that matched the query 
            selector.
        </p>

        <h3>Navigating the DOM Tree</h3>
        <p>
            Some of the nodes generated from HTML are text nodes generated from whitespace characters that show up on page.
            <ul>
                <li>childNodes property is a list of all the nodes that are children of the node concerned.</li>
                <li>children property returns any element nodes that are children of that node. It ignores any text nodes.</li>
                <li>firstChild property returns the first child of a node (might be whitespace text node)</li>
                <li>lastChild property returns the last child of a node (might return text node from whitespace)</li>
                <li>nextSibling property returns the next adjacent node of the same parent. Returns null if node is the last Child of that parent.</li>
                <li>previousSibling property returns the previous adjacent node. Returns null if the node is the first child of that parent.</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Finding the Value of a Node</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>nodeValue property returns the text within a text node</li>
                <li>textContent returns text within a text node. 
                    Internet Explorer 8 does not support this, but has the innerText property.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Getting and Setting An Element's Attributes</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>getAttribute() method returns the value of the attribute provided as an argument. Returns null if element does not have attribute.</li>
                <li>
                    setAttributed method can change the value of an element's attributes. Takes 2 arguments:
                    the attributed and the value that you want that attribute to be.
                </li>
                <li>className property allows the class of an element to be set directly.</li>
                <li>classList property is a list of all classes an element has. Here's its methods to modify the class of an element
                    <ul>
                        <li>classList.add() method can add a class to an element without overwriting any existing classes.</li>
                        <li>classList.remove() method removes a specific class from an element</li>
                        <li>classList.toggle() method adds class if the element doesn't have it and removes it if the element does have it.
                            returns true if class is added and false if it is removed.
                        </li>
                        <li>classList.contains() method will check to see if an element has a class</li>


                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Creating Dynamic Markup</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>document.createElement() method takes a tag name as a parameter and returns that element.</li>
                <li>document.createTextNode() method takes a parameter, which is a string containing the text that goes in the node.</li>
                <li>node objects have appendChild() method that adds another node as a child node. You can put a text node made 
                    with the createTextNode() method as an argument.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The process to add a text node to an element can be shortened using the textContent property
                    <pre>
const flash = document.createElement('li');
flash.textContent = 'Flash';
                    </pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Function to Create Elements</h3>
        <p>
            It's useful to create functions for creating elements to cut down on the lines of code.
            <pre>
                function createElement (tag,text) {
                    const el = document.createElement(tag);
                    el.textContent = text;
                    return el
                }
            </pre>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Adding Elements to Page</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The appendChild() method can add a new child node to the end of the list.</li>
                <li>insertBefore() places a new element before another element in the markup. This method is called on the parent
                    node and the first parameter is the node to be added. The second parameter is the node it will be added before.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Remove Elements From a Page</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>removeChild() method is called on the parent and removes the child node given as a parameter.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Replacing Elements on a Page</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>replaceChild() method can replace one node with another. Called on parent. Parameters: (new node, node to be replaced) </li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>innerHTML</h3>
        <p>
            Returns everything inside an HTML element. All of the raw HTML is returned.
            innerHTML is also writable. Assignment will replace everything inside. Is very good for inserting large amounts of HTML into the document.

        </p>

        <h3>Updating CSS</h3>
        <p>
            The style property of each node can be used to dynamically modify the presentation of any element on a web page.
            CSS properties can be treated like object properties, but they have to be converted to camelCase. For example, Here
            is how you use the CSS property, background-color: <br> superman.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
            <br><br>
            Bracket notation works too:<br>
            superman.style['background color'] = 'blue';
            <br<br>

            Changing the display property can cause elements to disappeaer and reappear. Set it to 'none' to disappear, and another
            value to make it reappear.
            <br> superman.style.display = 'none';
            <br><br>
            
            The style property can be used to check styles except for those set using an external stylesheet, which is the most common way to 
            set styles.
            The function: getComputedStyle() will return the style of the element passed as an argument.
            It has methods to get more specific information:
            <pre>getComputedStyle(superman).getPropertyCSSValue('color').cssText;</pre>
            <br><br>
            *****Use with Caution *****
            <br>It is better practice to dynamically change the class of an element on the fly
            and keep the styles for each class in a separate stylesheet. There are some cases 
            where it is useful if you don't have access to a stylesheet or its classes.
