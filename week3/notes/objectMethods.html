        <h2>Object Method Notes</h2>

        <p>
            Functions that are properties of objects are object methods. These allow 
            them to do actions that are related to the objects.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Method shorthand
        </h3>
        <p>
            Orginal:
            <pre>
                user = {
                    sayHi: function() {
                        alert("Hello");
                    }
                };
            </pre>
            Method shorthand(functions the same):
            <pre>
                user = {
                    sayHi() {
                        alert("Hello");
                    }
                };
            </pre>
        </p>
        <h3>"This" keyword in methods</h3>
        <p>
            The keyword "this" can be used to reference the object used to 
            call the method. It can be used to acccess object variables. If 
            there is a member variable called name then it can be referred to 
            using this.name  
        </p>

        <h3>"this" is not bound in javacript</h3>
        <p>When obj.f is called then this is obj during the call of f.
            <br><br>
            If this is called without an object then it is undefined. "this" can also
            refer to the global object, which could be a window in a browser.
            <br><br>
            The value of "this" ies evaluated at call-time.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrow function have no "this"</h3>
        <p>
            If "this" is called from within an arrow function then it will use "this" from
            the outer function. Example:
            <pre>
                let user = {
                    firstName: "Ilya",
                    sayHi() {
                      let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
                      arrow();
                    }
                  };
                  
                  user.sayHi(); // Ilya
            </pre>
        </p>
