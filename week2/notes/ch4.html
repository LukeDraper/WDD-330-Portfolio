        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions can be used to replace code in multiple places that does the same thing. 
            This allows you not to repeat yourself, but also it allows you to update a lot of code just by changing one piece.
            <ul>
                <li>To invoke a function through a variable you need to place parentheses after it: myFunction();
                    You won't use the parentheses if you are assigning the function to a new varaible.
                </li>
                <li>All functions return a value. The default return value is undefined, but it can be anything put after the return keyword.</li>
                <li>Arrow Functions
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arrow functions are best used for short, anonymous functions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Function Hoisting
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hoisting is the javascript interpreter's action of moving all variable and function declarations to the top of the current scope
                            regardless of where they are defined.
                        </li>
                        <li>Functions can be used before they are defined because of hoisting.</li>
                        <li>All function definitions can be placed together, rather than having to define every function before it is used.</li>

                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>Variable hoisting
                    <ul>
                        <li>variable declarations using the var keyword are hoisted.</li>
                        <li>Assignment is not hoisted. Variables have a value of undefined until assignment.
                        </li>
                        <li>It's best practice to use const or let at the beginninng of a block so hoisting is unnecessary.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Arguments and parameters</h3>
        <p> Paremeters that a function needs are set when the function is defined, but 
            when the function is invoked it is provided with arguments. Arguments take the 
            place of parameters when they are invoked.
            <ul>
                <li>Default Parameters can be specified
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: <br>function hello(name='World') { <br>
                            console.log(`Hello ${name}!);
                        }</li>
                        <li> Default Parameters should always come after non-default parameters
                            because otherwise you would be forced to enter the default parameters
                            anyway.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Callbacks</h3>
        <p>
            A function can be passed as an argument to another function. 
            The function that is passed is known as a callback.
            <br>
            Code to check if argument is a function:<br>
            if(typeof(callback) === 'function'){<br>
                callback();<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
            Callbacks are only useful for one-off tasks. It's usually better to keep
            functions separate and named for reuse.
        </p>
