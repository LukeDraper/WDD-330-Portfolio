        <p>
            //This is a single line comments
            <br>
            /* This is a <br>

            Comments are extremely important. How else will you remember what your code even does?

        <h3>Javascript Grammar</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Javascript uses C-style syntax</li>
            <li>semi-colons are automatically inserted in Javascript, but it's best to put them in yourself because errors can arise</li>
            <li>Blocks are sections of code within curly braces</li>
            <li>whitespace can be used freely</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>List of Reserved Words</h3>
        <p>abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the words are used in the language, some weren't.
            The following should have been reserved but weren't: undefined, NaN, Infinity

        </p>

        <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
        <p>
            There are 7 data types and 6 of them are primitive data types in Javascript:
            <ul>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Symbol</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>Undefined</li>
                <li>Null</li>
            </ul>
            All other data types are objects. Use typeof to determine data type.
            <br>
            Example:
            <br>
            typeof 10<br>
            &lt&lt 'number'
        </p>
        <h3>Assigning and Declaring Variable</h3>
        <p> 
            While using the <b>const</b> keyword, if it references a non-primitive data type
            like an array, function, or object then the data inside the object can change. This
            is known as mutating the object. 
            <br>
            Because const variables can't be changed, most variables should be declared as const
            to make the program more predictable.
        </p>
        <h3>Global Scope</h3>
        <p>Variables declared outsided any block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
            Variables with global scope should be kept to a minimum. They can mess things up with same variable names.
        </p>
        <h3>Assignment by Reference</h3>
        <p>
            Assigning a non-primitive value to a variable is done by reference.
            Any changes made will affect all references to that object.
        </p>
        <h3>Backslash is the escape character in strings. \\ Double backslash is used to place one backslash.</h3>
        <h3>Wrapper Objects</h3>
        <p>Only objects have properties and methods, so JS makes wrapper objects for primitive data types. This happens in the background.</p>
        <h3>Template Literals</h3>
        <p> JS can now use the backtick character ` to deliminate strings. This allows for used of both kinds of quotation marks inside one string without
            using the backslash. Interpolations can also be used freely inside the backtick characters. It's common to see backticks used for all strings
            in all ES6 code.
        </p>
        <h3>Symbols</h3>
        <p> Symbols are the only primitives without a literal form. They can create unique values.</p>

        <h3>Infinity</h3>
        <p>Infinity is used as an error for when there are numbers too big for the language to deal with. There is also -Infinity.</p>
        <h3>NaN</h3>
        <p>Error value for when an operation is attempted, but the result isn't numerical.</p>
        <h3>Type Coercion</h3>
        <p> When operations are performed JS tries to make the operands the same type. 
            Sometimes this doesn't work, so it is best to manually change types if needed.</p>
