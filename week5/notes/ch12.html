        <p>
            The blocking approach to event programming has the program check a condition at regular
            intervals. This blocks the rest of the program from executing.
            <br>The non-blocking approach used by Javascript uses event listeners to listen for 
            events to happen. Whenever events happen callback functions are called. The program
            can execute other code while waiting for the event.
        </p>

        <h3>Inline Event Handlers</h3>
        <p>
            Inline event handlers are those included directly in markup. Example:<br>
            <pre><p onclick="console.log('You Clicked Me!')">Click Me</p>

                this is p onclick="console.log('You Clicked Me!')">Click Me /p
                with actual opening and closing brackets on the paragraph tags.
                </pre>

        </p>

        <h3>Older Event Handlers</h3>
        <p>
            Here is an old version of an event hanndler:<br>
            document.onclick = function (){ console.log('You clicked on the page!'); }

            <br><br>This method works in almost all browsers, but only one function can be used for each event.

        </p>

        <h3>Using Event Listeners</h3>
        <p>
            Event listeners are the current standard way to deal with events.
            Use addEventListener() method. It can be called without a node to be applied to 
            the global object(usually the whole browser window.)
            <pre>
                document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);
            </pre>
            The parentheses are not placed after the function when it's used as the argument for the event
            listener. If they are, then the function will be called when the event listener is set.
            <br><br>
            When event handlers are triggered the callback function is called, and it 
            automatically passes an event object as a parameter. This can be used to get information about 
            an event.
            <pre>
                function doSomething(event){
                    console.log(event.type);
                }
            </pre>
            Event's properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Event has a type property that will return the type of event that occurred.</li>
                <li>the target property returns a reference to the node that fired the event.</li>
                <li>screenX and screen Y properties show the number of pixels from the left and top of the screen
                    respectively where the event took place.
                </li>
                <li>
                    clientxX and clientY properties show the number of pixels from the left and top of the client that is being used(usually the browser window).
                </li>
                <li>
                    pageX and pageY properties show the number of pixels from the left and top, respectively, where the event took place in the document.
                    Takes into account whether the page has been scrolled.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
